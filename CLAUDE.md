## Project Overview

This is a **Rotation-invariant Convolutional Dictionary Learning (Roto-CDL)** implementation for analyzing deep neural network activation maps. The project uses a fine-tuned AlexNet-based model on the Imagenette dataset and learns interpretable dictionary atoms from activation maps using rotation-equivariant sparse coding.

### Working with Jupyter Notebooks
The primary development workflow uses `main.ipynb`. There is no test suite in this repository.

## Architecture Overview

### Data Pipeline
1. **Data Preparation** (`preprocess.py`):
   - Downloads Imagenette-160px from Kaggle
   - Merges train/val splits
   - Renames class folders from IDs to readable names (e.g., `n01440764` → `tench`)
   - Final structure: `data/imagenette/{class_name}/`

2. **Feature Extraction** (`run_cdl.py` + `src/activation.py`):
   - Loads fine-tuned AlexNet model from `weights/finetune_weights.pth`
   - Target layer: `model.feature_extractor[5]` (MaxPool after 2nd conv block)
   - Uses GradCAM to identify influential channels
   - Collects activation maps from top-k% channels (default 90%)
   - Applies robust normalization (99th percentile clipping + scaling by 10)
   - Optional Gaussian blur to reduce sparsity

3. **Dictionary Learning** (`src/batch_cdl_large.py`):
   - Learns rotation-invariant atoms via Roto-CDL
   - Alternates between sparse coding (Z-step) and dictionary update (Phi-step)
   - Uses proximal gradient descent with non-negativity constraints

### Core Components

#### Model Architecture (`src/model.py`)
- **FineTunedModel**: AlexNet-style architecture with 10-class classifier
- Feature extractor: 5 conv blocks (64→192→384→256→256 channels)
- Classifier: AdaptiveAvgPool → 3 FC layers (9216→4096→4096→10)

#### Activation Analysis (`src/activation.py`, `src/gradcam.py`)
- **GradCAM**: Computes class-discriminative localization maps
- **ActivationMapCollector**: Extracts top-k% influential channels using GradCAM weights
- Channel selection uses cumulative weight sorting (top 90% by default)

#### Dictionary Learning (`src/batch_cdl_large.py`)
The core algorithm has two versions:

1. **Large-Scale Version** (`roto_cdl_large_scale`):
   - Handles datasets via mini-batch training
   - Gaussian noise initialization (not data patches)
   - Sparsity warmup: 0 for epoch 0, linear ramp to target over 5 epochs
   - Periodic atom re-centering (every 5 epochs)
   - Returns normalized dictionary Phi [n_atoms, 1, d, d]

2. **Standard Version** (`roto_cdl_batch_train` in `src/batch_cdl.py`):
   - Smart initialization from brightest data patches
   - Includes compactness penalty regularization
   - Pixel pruning for dead atoms

#### Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (`src/convsae.py`, `run_csae.py`)
Alternative approach to dictionary learning using a neural network-based sparse autoencoder:

- **ConvSAE Architecture**:
  - Encoder: Conv2d layer that maps activation maps to sparse feature space
  - Decoder: Conv2d layer that reconstructs activation maps from sparse features
  - Default: 1x1 convolutions for spatial sparsity
  - Hidden dimension: 4096 features (configurable)
  - Encoder bias parameter for fine-grained control

- **Training Objectives**:
  1. **Reconstruction Loss**: MSE between input and reconstructed activation maps
  2. **L1 Sparsity**: Encourages sparse activations in feature space
  3. **Lateral Inhibition**: Penalizes neighboring neurons firing together (prevents blob-like activations)

- **Key Features**:
  - Decoder weight normalization after each optimization step with **non-negativity constraint**
    - Since `feature_acts = ReLU(encoder(x))` are always non-negative, decoder weights are constrained to [0, 1]
    - Prevents negative contributions in reconstruction
    - Applied via `ReLU(weight)` before L2 normalization
  - Active neuron monitoring (tracks % of neurons firing per batch)
  - Comprehensive training diagnostics and visualization

- **Training Pipeline** (`run_csae.py`):
  1. Collects activation maps using same pipeline as CDL (via GradCAM + ActivationMapCollector)
  2. Applies robust normalization (99th percentile scaling)
  3. Trains ConvSAE with Adam optimizer
  4. Saves model state dict, full model (joblib), and training info
  5. Generates training log visualizations and learned feature visualizations

- **Output Files**:
  - `csae_model.pth`: PyTorch state dict for model weights
  - `csae_model.pkl`: Full model saved with joblib
  - `csae_training_info.pkl`: Training configuration and logs
  - `csae_training_logs.png`: 4-panel diagnostic plot (reconstruction, L1, lateral inhibition, active neurons)
  - `csae_features.png`: Visualization of learned decoder features

#### Dual Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (`src/convsae.py:DualConvSAE`, `run_dual_csae.py`)
**Problem**: Standard ConvSAE learns features that are shared across all classes, making it difficult to identify class-discriminative patterns.

**Solution**: Dual-pathway architecture that explicitly separates shared and class-specific features.

- **DualConvSAE Architecture**:
  - **Shared Pathway**: Learns global features common across all classes (unsupervised)
    - Shared encoder: Conv2d(in_channels → shared_dim)
    - Shared decoder: Conv2d(shared_dim → in_channels)
    - Loss: Reconstruction + L1 sparsity + Lateral inhibition

  - **Class-Specific Pathway**: Learns discriminative features for classification (supervised)
    - Class encoder: Conv2d(in_channels → class_dim)
    - Class decoder: Conv2d(class_dim → in_channels)
    - Classifier head: AdaptiveAvgPool2d → Linear(class_dim → num_classes)
    - Loss: Reconstruction + L1 sparsity + Lateral inhibition + Classification + Diversity

  - **Combined Reconstruction**: `recon = shared_decoder(shared_feats) + class_decoder(class_feats)`

- **Training Objectives**:
  1. **Shared Reconstruction**: MSE between shared pathway reconstruction and input
  2. **Class Reconstruction**: MSE between class pathway reconstruction and input
  3. **Total Reconstruction**: MSE between combined reconstruction and input
  4. **Shared Sparsity**: L1 penalty on shared features
  5. **Class Sparsity**: L1 penalty on class-specific features
  6. **Classification**: CrossEntropy loss on class predictions
  7. **Diversity**: Encourages different classes to activate different features (orthogonality)
  8. **Lateral Inhibition**: Applied to both pathways to prevent blob-like activations

- **Key Advantages**:
  - Explicitly separates global patterns (edges, textures) from class-specific patterns (object parts)
  - Classification head provides supervision for class pathway
  - Diversity loss ensures classes use different feature subsets
  - Shared pathway captures common low-level features, reducing redundancy
  - Class pathway focuses on discriminative high-level patterns

- **Hyperparameters** (`run_dual_csae.py`):
  - `shared_dim=256`: Number of shared features
  - `class_dim=256`: Number of class-specific features
  - `kernel_size=3`: 3×3 convolution for spatial context
  - `lambda_shared_l1=0.01`: Sparsity penalty for shared features
  - `lambda_class_l1=0.01`: Sparsity penalty for class features
  - `lambda_classification=1.0`: Classification loss weight
  - `lambda_diversity=0.1`: Diversity loss weight (encourages class separation)
  - `lr=3e-4`, `epochs=15`, `batch_size=256`

- **Training Pipeline** (`run_dual_csae.py`):
  1. Collects activation maps with class labels
  2. Trains dual pathways simultaneously
  3. Monitors classification accuracy and diversity metrics
  4. Saves both pathways and classifier
  5. Generates comprehensive visualizations

- **Output Files**:
  - `dual_csae_model.pth`: PyTorch state dict
  - `dual_csae_model.pkl`: Full model (joblib)
  - `dual_csae_training_info.pkl`: Training config and logs
  - `dual_csae_training_logs.png`: 3×4 diagnostic plot showing:
    - Row 1: Reconstruction losses, classification loss, accuracy
    - Row 2: Sparsity metrics, active neuron percentages, diversity loss
    - Row 3: Lateral inhibition, total loss, loss components, feature usage ratio
  - `dual_csae_features.png`: Weight distributions for both pathways

- **Monitoring During Training**:
  - **Classification Accuracy**: Should increase to 70-90% (validates class pathway is learning)
  - **Diversity Loss**: Should decrease (classes use different features)
  - **Active Neurons**: Both pathways should maintain 5-15% sparsity
  - **Feature Usage Ratio**: `shared_l1 / class_l1` ≈ 1.0 indicates balanced usage

- **When to Use Dual vs Standard ConvSAE**:
  - Use **Dual ConvSAE** when:
    - You need to identify class-discriminative features
    - Cross-class feature analysis shows too much overlap
    - You want interpretable separation between global and class-specific patterns
  - Use **Standard ConvSAE** when:
    - You want a simpler, faster model
    - Class labels are unavailable
    - Task is unsupervised feature discovery

#### Dual ConvSAE with ResNet18 Backbone (`run_dual_csae_resnet18.py`)
**Alternative to fine-tuned AlexNet**: Uses pretrained ResNet18 (ImageNet-1k) without fine-tuning.

**Key Advantages**:
- **No fine-tuning required**: Uses pretrained ImageNet weights directly
- **Better features**: ResNet18 provides stronger pretrained representations than AlexNet
- **Larger spatial resolution**: 14×14 activation maps (vs 13×13 for AlexNet layer 5)
- **More channels**: 256 channels from layer3 (vs variable for AlexNet)

**Architecture Details**:
- **Backbone**: ResNet18 pretrained on ImageNet-1k (1000 classes)
- **Target Layer**: `layer3` - outputs 256 channels at 14×14 spatial resolution
- **Class Mapping**: Maps ImageNet-1k predictions to Imagenette-10 classes
  - Tench → ImageNet class 0
  - English Springer Spaniel → ImageNet class 217
  - Cassette Player → ImageNet class 482
  - Chain Saw → ImageNet class 491
  - Church → ImageNet class 497
  - French Horn → ImageNet class 566
  - Garbage Truck → ImageNet class 569
  - Gas Pump → ImageNet class 571
  - Golf Ball → ImageNet class 574
  - Parachute → ImageNet class 701

**Activation Extraction Pipeline**:
1. For each image, get predicted Imagenette class from ImageNet-1k predictions
2. Use GradCAM on layer3 to compute channel importance for that class
3. Select top 90% of channels by cumulative GradCAM score
4. Average selected channels to create single-channel class-discriminative activation map
5. Apply robust normalization (99th percentile scaling)

**Training Configuration** (same as AlexNet version):
- `shared_dim=256`, `class_dim=256`
- `kernel_size=3` (3×3 convolution)
- Optimized loss weights for discrimination
- 15 epochs with warmup

**Output Files**:
- `dual_csae_resnet18_model.pth`: Model state dict
- `dual_csae_resnet18_model.pkl`: Full model (joblib)
- `dual_csae_resnet18_training_info.pkl`: Training config and logs
- `dual_csae_resnet18_logs.png`: Training diagnostics
- `dual_csae_resnet18_features.png`: Feature visualizations

**When to Use ResNet18 vs AlexNet**:
- Use **ResNet18** when:
  - You don't want to fine-tune a model
  - You want stronger pretrained features
  - You want faster iteration (no fine-tuning step)
  - You have limited training data
- Use **AlexNet** when:
  - You already have a fine-tuned model
  - You want features specifically adapted to your dataset
  - You need exact compatibility with existing pipelines

  - Grid view: Compact overview of all selected channels
- **Use Case**: Understanding what visual patterns in the input trigger specific feature maps at layer 5

### Key Algorithms

#### Rotation-Equivariant Reconstruction
```python
def reconstruct(phi, Z):
    # phi: [J, 1, d, d] - base atoms
    # Z: [N, J, K, H, W] - sparse codes with K rotations
    # Returns: [N, 1, H, W] - reconstructed maps
```
Uses grouped convolutions with rotated atoms (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).

#### Sparse Coding (Z-step)
- **Optimizer**: SGD with momentum (lr=3.0 for large-scale)
- **Constraint**: ReLU(Z - λ) after each gradient step
- **Iterations**: 30 steps per batch
- **Initialization**: Small random positive values

#### Dictionary Update (Phi-step)
- **Optimizer**: Adam (lr=0.05)
- **Constraint**: ReLU + L2 normalization per atom
- **Scheduler**: StepLR (gamma=0.5 every 10 epochs)

### Critical Implementation Details

1. **Data Normalization**:
   - Input images: ImageNet normalization (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
   - Activation maps: Robust 99th percentile scaling then × 10

2. **Hyperparameters** (from `run_cdl.py`):
   - `n_atoms=64`: Dictionary size
   - `n_rotations=4`: 90° rotation steps
   - `d=9`: Atom kernel size
   - `batch_size=1500`: For dictionary learning
   - `lr_phi=0.05`: Dictionary learning rate
   - `lr_z=3.0`: High LR to escape zero initialization
   - `sparsity=0.005`: L1 penalty coefficient

3. **ConvSAE Hyperparameters** (from `run_csae.py`):
   - `hidden_dim=4096`: Number of sparse features in latent space
   - `kernel_size=1`: Convolution kernel size (1x1 for spatial sparsity)
   - `lambda_l1=0.05`: L1 sparsity penalty coefficient (tuned for 5-15% activation)
   - `lambda_lat=0.02`: Lateral inhibition penalty coefficient
   - `lr=3e-4`: Learning rate for Adam optimizer
   - `epochs=20`: Number of training epochs
   - `batch_size=32`: Mini-batch size for ConvSAE training
   - **Target sparsity**: 5-15% active neurons per batch (monitored during training)

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Activation collection uses `batch_size=1` to save VRAM
   - Dictionary learning loads full data to VRAM if possible
   - Falls back to CPU if OOM

5. **Model Checkpoint**:
   - Required file: `weights/finetune_weights.pth`
   - Must be downloaded separately (see README)

## Using the Explanation Pipeline

The `explain.py` module provides a complete explainability system. Basic usage:

```python
from explain import ExplanationPipeline, load_learned_dictionary
from src.model import FineTunedModel

# Load model and dictionary
model = FineTunedModel(num_classes=10).to(device)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('weights/finetune_weights.pth'))
phi_learned = load_learned_dictionary('phi_learned_imagenette.pkl', device)

# Create explainer
explainer = ExplanationPipeline(model, phi_learned, device)

# Generate explanation
results = explainer.explain_prediction(
    image=test_image,
    cumulative_threshold=0.8,  # Select maps with 80% cumulative score
    lr_z=3.0,
    sparsity=0.005,
    n_steps_z=50
)

# Visualize
explainer.visualize_explanation(results, save_path='output.png')
```

The pipeline outputs:
- `explanation_output.png`: Overview showing input, GradCAM, and per-channel decomposition
- `atom_activations_detail.png`: Detailed spatial activation patterns for top atoms

## Using the Trained ConvSAE

After training with `run_csae.py`, you can use the ConvSAE for analyzing activation maps:

```python
import torch
import joblib
from src.convsae import ConvSAE

# Method 1: Load full model (easiest)
csae_model = joblib.load('csae_model.pkl').to(device)

# Method 2: Load state dict (if you need to recreate the model)
csae_model = ConvSAE(in_channels=1, hidden_dim=4096, kernel_size=1).to(device)
csae_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('csae_model.pth'))

# Load training info
training_info = joblib.load('csae_training_info.pkl')
print(f"Training config: {training_info['config']}")
print(f"Final metrics: {training_info['final_metrics']}")

# Use the model for inference
csae_model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    # activation_map: [1, 1, H, W] - single activation map
    reconstruction, sparse_features = csae_model(activation_map)

    # sparse_features: [1, 4096, H, W] - sparse representation
    # reconstruction: [1, 1, H, W] - reconstructed activation map

    # Analyze sparsity
    active_features = (sparse_features > 0).float().mean().item()
    print(f"Active features: {active_features * 100:.2f}%")

    # Get top-k activated features
    feature_importance = sparse_features.sum(dim=(2, 3)).squeeze()  # [4096]
    top_k = 10
    top_features = torch.topk(feature_importance, top_k)
    print(f"Top {top_k} features: {top_features.indices.tolist()}")
```

The ConvSAE provides:
- Sparse representation of activation maps in a learned feature space
- Reconstruction for validating the learned representation
- Feature-level analysis (which features activate for which patterns)

## Using the ConvSAE Explanation Pipeline

The `explain_csae.py` module provides a complete explainability system using the trained ConvSAE. Basic usage:

```bash
# Explain a single image
python explain_csae.py --image_path data/imagenette/tench/n01440764_1.JPEG

# Analyze multiple images from a class
python explain_csae.py --class_name tench --num_images 3

# Customize parameters
python explain_csae.py \
  --image_path data/imagenette/church/n03028079_15.JPEG \
  --cumulative_threshold 0.8 \
  --top_k_features 10 \
  --max_channels 5
```

Programmatic usage:

```python
from explain_csae import CSAEExplainer
from src.model import FineTunedModel
import joblib

# Load model and CSAE
model = FineTunedModel(num_classes=10).to(device)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('weights/finetune_weights.pth'))
csae_model = joblib.load('csae_model.pkl').to(device)

# Create explainer
explainer = CSAEExplainer(model, csae_model, device)

# Generate explanation
results = explainer.explain_prediction(
    image_path='data/imagenette/tench/n01440764_1.JPEG',
    cumulative_threshold=0.8,  # Select maps with 80% cumulative score
    top_k_features=10          # Analyze top 10 CSAE features per channel
)

# Visualize
explainer.visualize_explanation(results, save_path='csae_explanation.png')
```

The CSAE explanation pipeline:
1. Uses GradCAM to compute channel importance weights at layer 5
2. Selects top-k activation maps with cumulative score ≥ threshold (default 80%)
3. For each selected activation map, applies robust normalization (same as training)
4. Passes normalized activation through trained CSAE encoder
5. Identifies top-k activated CSAE features and their spatial patterns
6. Visualizes: input image, GradCAM, per-channel activation maps, CSAE reconstructions, top features, and spatial activation patterns

The pipeline outputs:
- `csae_explanation_{image_name}.png`: Comprehensive visualization showing:
  - Input image and GradCAM overlay
  - Original and normalized activation maps for selected channels
  - CSAE reconstruction quality (MSE)
  - Top 5 activated features per channel (bar chart with decoder weights)
  - Spatial activation patterns of the top feature

## Analyzing Same-Class ConvSAE Features

The `check_same_class_csae.py` script analyzes whether images from the same class activate similar ConvSAE features, validating semantic consistency.

### Single Class Analysis

```bash
python check_same_class_csae.py --class_name tench --num_images 10
```

This will:
1. Sample 10 images from the "tench" class
2. For each image, extract layer 5 activation maps using GradCAM
3. Apply CSAE to get sparse feature activations
4. Identify top-k activated features per image
5. Compute feature frequency (how many images activate each feature)
6. Generate visualization showing:
   - Sample images from the class
   - Top 20 most frequently activated features (bar chart with percentages)
   - Feature activation heatmap (images × features matrix)

Output: `same_class_csae_analysis/{class_name}_csae_analysis.png`

### Cross-Class Comparison

```bash
python check_same_class_csae.py --compare_classes tench church parachute --num_images 10
```

This will:
1. Analyze each class independently (as above)
2. Build feature-class activation matrix
3. Identify class-specific features (high activation in one class, low in others)
4. Generate comparison visualization showing:
   - Feature-class heatmap (which features activate for which classes)
   - Top 20 class-specific features with their dominant class
   - Class specificity scores

Output:
- Individual class analyses: `same_class_csae_analysis/{class_name}_csae_analysis.png`
- Comparison: `same_class_csae_analysis/class_comparison_csae.png`

### Interpretation

- **High-frequency features** (appearing in >70% of same-class images): Represent consistent class-specific patterns
- **Class-specific features** (high specificity score): Strongly associated with one class, useful for discrimination
- **Shared features** (low specificity): General patterns used across multiple classes
- **Heatmap patterns**: Vertical bands indicate features consistently used by specific classes

### Parameters

- `--num_images`: Number of images to sample per class (default: 10)
- `--top_k_features`: Number of top features to track per image (default: 50)
- `--cumulative_threshold`: GradCAM channel selection threshold (default: 0.8)

## Common Modifications

When modifying the sparse coding solver (`solve_z_prox_adam`):
- Line 64 in `src/batch_cdl_large.py`
- Critical parameters: learning rate, momentum, number of iterations
- Must maintain non-negativity constraint and sparsity penalty

When changing the target layer for activation extraction:
- Modify `target_layer = model.feature_extractor[X]` in `run_cdl.py`
- Earlier layers = lower-level features (edges, textures)
- Later layers = higher-level features (object parts)
- Default: Layer 5 (after 2nd conv block) balances spatial resolution and semantic content

When adjusting the explanation pipeline (`explain.py`):
- `cumulative_threshold`: Controls how many activation maps to analyze (default 0.8 = 80%)
- `lr_z` and `sparsity`: Control sparse coding quality (match training values: 3.0 and 0.005)
- `n_steps_z`: More steps = better decomposition but slower (default 50)
- `top_atoms_per_map`: How many atoms to show per activation map (default 5)

When adjusting the CSAE explanation pipeline (`explain_csae.py`):
- `cumulative_threshold`: Controls how many activation maps to analyze (default 0.8 = 80%)
- `top_k_features`: Number of top CSAE features to analyze per channel (default 10)
- `max_channels`: Maximum number of channels to visualize (default 5)
- The robust normalization (99th percentile scaling × 10) is automatically applied, matching training preprocessing
- Each visualization shows: original activation, normalized activation, CSAE reconstruction, top features with decoder weights, and spatial patterns

When adjusting ConvSAE training (`run_csae.py`):
- `hidden_dim`: Increase for more expressive features, decrease for more compact representation (default: 4096)
- `kernel_size`: Use 1 for spatial sparsity (features activate at specific locations), use 3+ for more spatial context
- `lambda_l1`: **Critical for sparsity control** (default: 0.05)
  - If "Active Neurons %" > 30%: **Increase** `lambda_l1` (try 0.1, 0.2, or higher)
  - If "Active Neurons %" < 2%: **Decrease** `lambda_l1` (try 0.01, 0.005)
  - **Target range**: 5-15% active neurons
- `lambda_lat`: Higher values = stronger lateral inhibition, prevents blob-like activations (default: 0.02)
- Training will automatically warn you if sparsity is outside the target range
- If reconstruction loss plateaus early while sparsity is good, the model has converged successfully
